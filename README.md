# Team Project for APAD
Team Members List: Shruthi Sundaranand, Harini Ala, Joshua George, Abhinav Sharma, and Shreyas KV

The well-known Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model has now expanded to several online services,
including Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Hardware-as-a-
Services (HaaS). With the cloud now supporting these and many other services, the term
Everything as a Service (XaaS) was coined to refer to the extensive variety of emerging services
and applications that people can access on demand over the Internet as opposed to being housed
on-premises. According to a new report by Research Insights titled â€œGlobal Everything-as-a-
service (XaaS) Market Research Report 2019-2026", the XaaS market is expected to grow to more
than $345 billion (about $1,100 per person in the US) over the next few years. Many industries
are now adopting the on-demand approach of acquiring services through cloud computing
because it offers agility and flexibility, allowing companies to acquire technology quickly and with
fewer up-front costs than they would with a purchase and license agreement.
In this project, we will bring together the tools and techniques (marked in italics in this document)
that we are learning in the class to implement a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a web application
(henceforth, referred to as the app) for a functioning HaaS system. This PoC app is inspired by
the University of Utah POWDER program (https://powderwireless.net/ ). The overall nature of
the app is predefined, but your team can be creative in adding features that exceed the
stakeholder needs.
A simplified software architecture of the app is shown in Figure 1 below

This project will be done with your chosen project team, and you will submit just one
deliverable for the entire team during each phase. Each team should contain no more than 5 to
6 students.
