The well-known Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model has now expanded to several online services,
including Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Hardware-as-a-
Services (HaaS). With the cloud now supporting these and many other services, the term
Everything as a Service (XaaS) was coined to refer to the extensive variety of emerging services
and applications that people can access on demand over the Internet as opposed to being housed
on-premises. According to a new report by Research Insights titled â€œGlobal Everything-as-a-
service (XaaS) Market Research Report 2019-2026", the XaaS market is expected to grow to more
than $345 billion (about $1,100 per person in the US) over the next few years. Many industries
are now adopting the on-demand approach of acquiring services through cloud computing
because it offers agility and flexibility, allowing companies to acquire technology quickly and with
fewer up-front costs than they would with a purchase and license agreement.
In this project, we will bring together the tools and techniques (marked in italics in this document)
that we are learning in the class to implement a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a web application
(henceforth, referred to as the app) for a functioning HaaS system. This PoC app is inspired by
the University of Utah POWDER program (https://powderwireless.net/ ). The overall nature of
the app is predefined, but your team can be creative in adding features that exceed the
stakeholder needs.
A simplified software architecture of the app is shown in Figure 1 below
